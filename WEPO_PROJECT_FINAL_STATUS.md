# WEPO Project - Final Status & Next Steps

## Status Notice

This file is historical and contains stale bridge-era completion claims.

It should not be read as the current production-readiness assessment.

Current reality:

- `WEPO` is still being production-hardened
- the canonical local verification path is `/home/sparky/WEPO/wepo-blockchain/scripts/run_canonical_fee_smoke.sh`
- the canonical local smoke validates the FastAPI backend plus the full node fee-settlement path, not `wepo-fast-test-bridge.py`

## 🚀 **Ready for Deployment**

### **Network Deployment (30 minutes)**
```bash
# Complete deployment package ready:
cd /app/wepo-production-deployment/
./upload-and-deploy.sh

# Result: Live WEPO network at https://api.wepo.network
```

### **User Distribution**
- **Desktop Wallet**: Ready for GitHub releases
- **Web Wallet**: Ready for web hosting
- **iOS App**: Handoff document created for next engineer

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **1. Network Deployment (You)**
**Time Required**: 30 minutes  
**Cost**: $25/month for server

```bash
# Steps:
1. Get DigitalOcean server (4GB RAM, $24/month)
2. Get domain (api.wepo.network)
3. Edit upload-and-deploy.sh with your server IP
4. Run deployment script
5. Test live network
```

### **2. GitHub Distribution (You)**
**Time Required**: 15 minutes

```bash
# Steps:
1. Create GitHub repository: wepo-desktop-wallet
2. Upload /app/wepo-desktop-wallet/ contents
3. Create release with wepo-desktop-wallet-v1.0.0.tar.gz
4. Users download and run start-wallet.bat
```

### **3. iOS Development (Next Engineer)**
**Time Required**: 3-4 months  
**Deliverable**: TestFlight beta app

```bash
# Next engineer has:
- Complete handoff document (/app/WEPO_iOS_HANDOFF_DOCUMENT.md)
- Working backend API to integrate with
- Reference React components to port
- Complete feature specifications
```

## 👩‍💻 Engineer-to-Engineer Communication (Latest Changes)

- Pre-Genesis UX: Non-blocking banners removed; Send WEPO/Vault disabled; BTC usable; Mining allows early connect
- Dashboard: 8-tile grid order (Send, Receive, PoW, PoS, Vault, Messaging, Settings, Logout)
- PoS: Button visible with "Activates at Block 131,400"; opens StakingInterface (not yet active)
- Settings (staging-only controls):
  - Simulate PoW / Simulate Pre-Genesis → POST /api/mining/_toggle_genesis
  - BTC relay controls: checkbox "Relay BTC via Masternodes only" (sessionStorage: btc_relay_only)
  - Show Last BTC Relay (reads sessionStorage btc_last_relay_status)
- BTC Masternode Relay (self-custodial preserved):
  - POST /api/bitcoin/relay/broadcast { rawtx, relay_only }
  - GET /api/bitcoin/relay/status
  - Broadcast wired in frontend (SelfCustodialBitcoinWallet.js)
- Security: Full Prelaunch Security Suite re-run → 87/100 (GO)
- Testing: Frontend suite passed (dashboard, mining connect, PoS view, vault modal, settings block height, security headers)

### Staging Test Notes
- REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL used for all frontend API calls (no hardcoding)
- Genesis flip is staging-only and should be removed or gated for production
- BTC init/sync endpoints are placeholders to unblock UI; replace with real indexer integration when ready

## 🎯 **Final Recommendations**

### **Priority 1: Deploy Network (This Week)**
The technology is ready. Deploy the network to establish the infrastructure and begin user testing.

### **Priority 2: iOS Development (Start Immediately)**
Begin iOS development while network is being deployed. The handoff document provides everything needed.

### **Priority 3: Community Building**
With live network and working wallets, begin building community ahead of the public genesis launch.
